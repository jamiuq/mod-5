1. 
- assertEquals can check if actual results match expected results
- The @test annotation is used to mark a method as a test method
- The purpose of unit tests is to ensure that code runs as expected

assertEquals: Checks if the expected outcome equals the actual outcome.
assertNotEquals: Ensures the actual outcome is not equal to the expected outcome.
assertArrayEquals: Compares two arrays for equality.
assertTrue and assertFalse: Check if a condition is true or false, respectively.
assertNull and assertNotNull: Verify if a value is null or not.
assertSame and assertNotSame: Check if two references point to the same object or not.
assertThrows: Verifies that a specific exception is thrown.
assertTimeout: Ensures a method completes within a specified time.

I looked at Matt Greencroft's profile and he did not have any active courses. I could not find the video.
